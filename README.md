# VersionOne Integration for HP-ALM

Copyright (c) 2008-2015 [VersionOne](http://versionone.com/). All rights reserved.

The VersionOne Integration for HP-ALM provides a two-way flow of information for tests and defects. The flow of test data makes it possible to monitor the quality of your projects more easily by making the latest test results visible in VersionOne. Teams can leverage existing test plans and test reporting, while creating new tests based on current user stories/backlog items. The flow of defect data makes it possible to triage defects and include them in the planning process to balance new work and maintenance.
